          With both being a large dog species, pitbulls were used as a nanny dog
          while boxers are naturally known for their protection and knack for

          The Bullboxer Pit is a mixed breed dog â€” a cross between the Boxer and
          American Pit Bull Terrier dog breeds. Powerful, faithful, and
          energetic, these pups inherited some of the best traits from both of
          their parents. Bullboxer Pits are also sometimes called the Pixoter or
          American Bullboxer.
